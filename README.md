# My simple Bash PS1

Simple bash ps1 that contains all the information that I need and is organized to my liking.

Also contains a tmux file for the tmux of my liking.

### TODO

* Make so that when the like breaks inside the PS1 it breaks outside the little blocks "`[]`"
* Check if the last command ended with a new line and if not add one (if it is even possible)
